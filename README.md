## CS Undergraduate Community

### App Description
Area to foster a community between local CS individuals. Has the ability to connect individuals based on interests, while supplying resources and events


### App Idea Evaluation

- Mobile: mobile
- Story: Messaging and resource application for those interest in CS.
- Market: Regardless of CS ability, all individuals in use the application to grow their network and skills
- Habit: Dependent on other users to match with other CS invividuals to foster a community, but resource and event features require only a single user
- Scope: Can start with a resource bank and chat room, and expand to a more "Tinder" style where you match with other users with similar goals (ex. develop skills, hang out at events, etc.)
